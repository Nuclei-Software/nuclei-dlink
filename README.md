## Description

RV-LINK: In application debugger for RISC-V microcontrollers, RISC-V emulator, use RISC-V development boards (Longan Nano for example). 

Like [Blackmagic](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic), but designed for RISC-V.

This (mirrored) GitHub repository is originally cloned from https://gitee.com/zoomdy/RV-LINK, but here it includes various improvements.
The main developments take place in GitLab [here](https://gitlab.melroy.org/micha/RV-LINK).
